**Brief Introduction**

In the report we'll try to build a model for predicting "how (well)" lifting activity was performed by the wearer(of devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit) using 'Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset'. 

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

**Data loading and preprocessing**

At first lets include all the required libraries
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

and load data into the R:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Don't be confused. I have MatLab and R projects in the same folder :)
setwd('C:\\Users\\Dmi\\Desktop\\MatLab\\Coursera\\MachineLearning')
data.train <- read.csv('pml-training.csv')
data.test <- read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
```

Now lets see what the training data we have using `glimpse` from `dplyr` package. I give the code, but the output is too big to include:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(data.train)
```

From the `glimpse` output we can see that there are 160 different variables and a lot of variables are with NAs or have empty values.
Lets clean our data from these 'bad' variables. Also lets delete first 5 variables from the data (row number, username and 3 timestamps) and omit all the residual rows with NAs. We preprocess both train and test data similary:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# deleting zero variance variables
zeroVar <- nearZeroVar(data.train)
data.train <- data.train[,-zeroVar]
data.test <- data.test[, -zeroVar]
# deleting variables with many NAs
manyNAs <- sapply(data.train, function(x){
                                          sum(as.integer(is.na(x))) > 19000
                                         })
data.train <- data.train[, !manyNAs]
data.test <- data.test[, !manyNAs]
# deleting row number, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_#, cvtd_timestamp
data.train <- data.train[,-c(1:5)]
data.test <- data.test[, -c(1:5)]
# omit all rows with NAs
data.train <- na.omit(data.train)
data.test <- na.omit(data.test)
```

Now lets look at the cleaned data. Again I give the code but don't include output because of big size:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(data.train)

```

We won't center and scale data because Random Forest algorithm which we'll use is rather stable with unscaled data.

**Building model**

Now we have our data cleaned and with 53 variables instead of 160. 
Our task is to build a *classification model*. We'll use a Random Forest algorithm for that.
Our final task is to predict 20 values. It means that we roughly **need prediction accuracy more than 0.95**.
At first lets split our data into two pieces (training and test). For training data we'll take 0.7 of the original data and the rest part will be for testing.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
train <- createDataPartition(data.train$classe, p = 0.7, list=F)
train.train <- data.train[train,]
train.test <- data.train[-train,]
```

Now we need to create formula and start training our model. We'll make 20-fold cross validation with 4 repeats:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
trFormula <- classe ~ .
trControl <- trainControl(method='cv', number = 20, repeats = 4)
train.rf <- train(trFormula, trControl=trControl, data = train.train )
```
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
load('train.rf.Rda')
```

After some time we have our model trained. Lets look at the top important variables of the model:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
head(varImp(train.rf)[[1]])
```

Now lets look at a confusion matrix and plot error rate:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
confusionMatrix(predict(train.rf, train.train), train.train$classe)
plot(train.rf$finalModel, main='Error rate')
```

We see that our cross validation gives us an **estimation of accuracy between 0.9988 and 0.9997**. And from plot we can see that the error goes to stable level.

Now lets see a confusion matrix for a prediciton and plot a nice figure for the normalized confusion matrix:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
confusionMatrix(predict(train.rf, train.test), train.test$classe)
input.matrix <- table(predict(train.rf, train.test), train.test$classe)
preObj <- preProcess(input.matrix, method=c("range"))
input.matrix.normalized <- predict(preObj, input.matrix)
colnames(input.matrix.normalized) = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
rownames(input.matrix.normalized) = colnames(input.matrix.normalized)
confusion <- as.data.frame(as.table(input.matrix.normalized))
plot <- ggplot(confusion)
plot + geom_tile(aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=Freq)) + 
       scale_x_discrete(name="Actual Class") + 
       scale_y_discrete(name="Predicted Class") + 
       scale_fill_gradient(breaks=seq(from=-.5, to=4, by=.2)) + 
       labs(fill="Normalized\nFrequency")
```

And finally lets make predictions for the required 20 rows of the test data and save the output to different files:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
answers <- predict(train.rf, data.test)
answers <- as.character(answers)
pml_write_files = function(x){
     n = length(x)
     for(i in 1:n){
          filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
          write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
     }
}
pml_write_files(answers)
```

**Conclusion**

We have built a model which predicts "how (well)" an lifting activity was performed. *Cross validation showed accuracy between 0.9988 and 0.9997, which is more than required 0.95*. All the required course project predictions were made correctly.
